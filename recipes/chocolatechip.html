    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These copycat Crumbl milk chocolate chip cookies use premium chocolate chips and one interesting technique, but are not hard to bake at home. They taste just like the cookies you love.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 ounces milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>flaky sea salt for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, and kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk until well incorporated; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add butter, brown sugar, and white sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs one at a time, until just combined. Add in vanilla; gradually add in dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Using a 1/2 cup measure, scoop balls of dough into hands and form into a loose ball. Place cookie dough balls on a rimmed baking sheet and place in refrigerator for about 1 hour or until ready to bake. Alternatively, place in the freezer for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment. Working in batches of 3 or 4 cookies per baking sheet, carefully tear each dough ball in half and place one half on top of the other with the broken, jagged side up. Gently press the 2 halves together, taking care not to smooth the top. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges and barely set in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky salt if desired. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet.</li>        
    </ol>
